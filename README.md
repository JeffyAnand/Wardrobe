# Wardrobe

This repository contains the code for a small online clothing store project (Angular frontend in `online_store/` and an API in `api/`).

Repository name (remote): `Wardrobe` â€” please provide the remote repository URL so I can add it and push the initial commit.

## What I added
- A sensible `.gitignore` at the repository root.

## How I'll publish (what will happen once you provide the remote URL)
1. `git init` (if needed) and make initial commit
2. `git remote add origin <your-remote-git-url>`
3. `git push -u origin main`

## How to run locally (short)
- Backend (api):
  - cd `api`
  - npm install
  - npm start

- Frontend (online_store):
  - cd `online_store`
  - npm install
  - ng serve --open


## Notes
- I didn't change any source code. If you'd like, I can also add a LICENSE and a GitHub Actions CI workflow.
